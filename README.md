# Angular, NodeJS and Express Scaffold!

Start an awesome app with AngularJS on the front, Express + Node on the back. This project is an
application skeleton for a typical [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) web app for those who want
to use Node to serve their app.

The seed contains angular libraries, test libraries and a bunch of scripts all preconfigured for
instant web development gratification. Just clone the repo and
you're ready to develop your application.

The seed app shows how to wire together Angular client-side components with Express on the server.

## How to use angular-express-seed

Clone the angular-express-seed repository, run `npm install` under the `server` folder to grab the dependencies, and start hacking!

### Running the app

Runs like a typical express app:

    node app.js
